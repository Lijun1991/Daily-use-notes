C++ is a statically typed, compiled, general-purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming.

Object-Oriented Programming
Encapsulation
Data hiding
Inheritance
Polymorphism

The files you create with your editor are called source files and for C++ they typically are named with the extension .cpp, .cp, or .c.

Object − Objects have Properties and Behaviors. Example: A dog has Properties - color, name, breed as well as Behaviors - wagging, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.

Class − A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behaviors/states that object of its type support.

Methods − A method is basically a behavior. A class can contain many methods. It is in methods where the logics are written, data is manipulated and all the actions are executed.

Instance Variables − Each object has its unique set of instance variables. An object's state is created by the values assigned to these instance variables.


using namespace std
Tells the compiler to use the std namespace. Namespaces are a relatively recent addition to C++.

//compile use g++ instead of gcc
g++ test.cpp
./a.out

cout << "Hello World"; // prints Hello World

x = y; y = y+1; add(x, y);

C++ is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C++.

//variables
mohd       zara    abc   move_name  a_123
myname50   _temp   j     a23b9      retVal

Trigraphs
A few characters have an alternative representation, called a trigraph sequence
??=	 #
??/	 \
??'	 ^
??(	 [
??)	 ]
??!	 |
??<	 {
??>	 }
??-	 ~

//C++ Data Types    https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_data_types.htm
endl,   which inserts a new-line character after every line 
<<   operator is being used to pass multiple values out to the screen

typedef int feet;

Enumerated Types: ???
enum color { red, green, blue } c;
c = blue;

enum color { red, green=5, blue };


???//Variable Definition in C++
int    i, j, k;
extern int d = 3, f = 5;    // declaration of d and f. ???
int d = 3, f = 5;           // definition and initializing d and f. 

For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables is undefined. ???

When a local variable is defined, it is not initialized by the system, you must initialize it yourself. Global variables are initialized automatically by the system when you define them as follows:
int	    0
char	'\0'
float	0
double	0
pointer	NULL


Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter and they are called literals.

Integer literals
212         // Legal
215u        // Legal
0xFeeL      // Legal
078         // Illegal: 8 is not an octal digit
032UU       // Illegal: cannot repeat a suffix
85         // decimal
0213       // octal
0x4b       // hexadecimal
30         // int
30u        // unsigned int
30l        // long
30ul       // unsigned long

Boolean literals
true/false

Character literals
\\	\ character
\'	' character
\"	" character
\?	? character
\a	Alert or bell
\b	Backspace
\f	Form feed
\n	Newline
\r	Carriage return
\t	Horizontal tab
\v	Vertical tab
\ooo	Octal number of one to three digits
\xhh . . .	Hexadecimal number of one or more digits

String literals
"hello, dear" = "hello, " "d" "ear" = "hello, \
dear"

Defining Constants
There are two simple ways in C++ to define constants:
Using #define preprocessor.
Using const keyword.

#define LENGTH 10   
#define WIDTH  5
#define NEWLINE '\n' 
=
const int  LENGTH = 10;
const int  WIDTH  = 5;
const char NEWLINE = '\n';

Type Qualifiers in C++
const
volatile
restrict

Storage Classes in C++
auto

register

static

extern

mutable
