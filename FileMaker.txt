    Design: a feature/app
    For: who are you desgining for
    To : what they would do with the app
    So : result

Databese Application --> called FileMaker

Spreadsheet, data integrity issue, same data multiple places

Table
Blueprint for realtionships
    ERD --> entity(table) realtionship diagram --> one to one, one to multiple, multiple to multiple
    rows --> records
    coloums --> fields --> Primary Key fields/Foriegn Key fields --> link tables together

Relational Databese Design:
our rules is to get one to many, if many to many change it to one to many
    EX: Customers(pk)  Invoices(pk, fk-Customers)  Invoice-line-iterms(fk-Products, fk-Invoices)  Products(pk)
        actors(pk)  roles(fk-actors fk-movies)  movies(pk)
    
    one --> get Primary Key fields (unicly identify a record)
    many/multiple --> get Foriegn Key fields

    to avoid redundency, BOWRROW fields from other table, related table 
    when link child to parent will give it a list of valid child value --> pop up list
    also when you change it, your parent would change as well.
    borrow data from Parent as well as your child
    Portal, you will only use a portal as a layout in Parent and get data form child.
    allow creation of records in this talbe via this realtionship --> edit data realtionship to allow user to add value to portal to create realted value
    
    query types of realtionships that can be used for specialized purpose.
    realtionship graph can create more than one table occurrence per table in your database, can have it's own properties, seperate from the original one,
    table plus --> name as where this talbe is going to be used + the name of the talbe this one base on + what feature you want to unicly.
    two match fileds in one realtionship --> query the data you need to put on your portal
