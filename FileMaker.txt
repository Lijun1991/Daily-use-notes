1. Problems statement (address the painpoint you identified from your client)
    Design: a feature/app
    For: who are you desgining for
    To : what they would do with the app
    So : result

2. Databese Application --> called FileMaker

3. Spreadsheet, data integrity issue, same data multiple places
4. FileMaker Server key: 31X7M-K2T22-384KK-T145V-278NM-J7NXJ-X31N7

5. Tables
    Blueprint for realtionships
        ERD --> entity(table) realtionship diagram --> one to one, one to multiple, multiple to multiple
        rows --> records
        coloums --> fields --> Primary Key fields/Foriegn Key fields --> link tables together

    Relational Databese Design: modling realtionships
    our rules is to get one to many, if many to many change it to one to many
        EX: Customers(pk)  Invoices(pk, fk-Customers)  Invoice-line-iterms(fk-Products, fk-Invoices)  Products(pk)
            actors(pk)  roles(fk-actors fk-movies)  movies(pk)
        
        one --> get Primary Key fields (unicly identify a record)
        many/multiple --> get Foriegn Key fields

        to avoid redundency, BOWRROW fields from other table, related table 
        when link child to parent will give it a list of valid child value --> pop up list
        also when you change it, your parent would change as well.
        borrow data from Parent as well as your child
        Portal, you will only use a portal as a layout in Parent and get data form child.
        allow creation of records in this talbe via this realtionship --> edit data realtionship to allow user to add value to portal to create realted value
        
        query types of realtionships that can be used for specialized purpose.
        realtionship graph can create more than one table occurrence per table in your database, can have it's own properties, seperate from the original one,
        table plus --> name as where this talbe is going to be used + the name of the talbe this one base on + what feature you want to unicly.
        two match fileds in one realtionship --> query the data you need to put on your portal
        EX: All the orders realted to the Customers 
            All the orders realted to the Customers has been shipped
            All the orders realted to the Customers are going to ship in the feature

        OR using portal filter to change the portal's perspective to match criteria
        Lol, copy the data occurrence and filter it, create date range, Lol .......

6. Fields
    Talk to your Customers to find out what fields are meaningful for their business
    Auto entere:
        type, create by departmet name, created by account name, 
        Data: auto entered value, can be edit by your Customers
        ***Prohibit modification ***

    validation:
    data consistency, reliable --> , not empty, error massage

    storge:
    container field --> movies, pictures, files. --> drag and drop, copy, paste --> 4G limit each
    store cantinar data externally, won't impact the database itself.

7. Records:
    new window, duplite

8. **Importing data, Spreadsheet, filemaker file, comma-seperated values
    change, add, what record not import, pk changes
9. Export data
    find mode --> get data --> export to Spreadsheet or file

10. Layout:
    Each layout built base on certain table 
    layout mode -> pencil(layout setup) -> views -> check for layout you want user to see
    part setup
    inspector --> command i
    manage layout --> command shitf L  --> mangage what show out to your users when they browse or create new layout
    rulers, points or inches
    color --> select theme colors

11. **Find Data/Sort Data

12. Value List --> custome or alll
13. Print/Save as PDF or excel
14. Report, subsummary fileds, add charts

15. Calculations, --> date time hide filed, recode refill, getfunctions(users, data) --> get commitions!!!

16 ****Scripts --> Print Button setup
    perform find mode --> print out all status is send 
    enter find mode --> let the user to enter their own critier
    EX1: 
        Customer Welcome Letter Scripts (Print out letters )
        1. Navigate to cusomer welcome letter layout
        2. Set page setup to print only current record
        3. Print
        4. Navigate back to original layout

        enter find mode
        perform find --> set find criteria to print 
        go to layout
        print setup
        print
        show custom dialog --> Get ( FoundCount ) & " letters have been printed"

    EX2:
        create New customer window
        1. open new window (it's just gonna inherit the layout that you are on already)
        2. Navigate to new "add customer" layout
        3. fill in new records, create new record
        4. click on ADD to save the record and close the window

        new window --> card, add layout
        new record/request
        (button add to close window)

    EX3: 
        print dif letters to different status customers
        If status=active 
            go to layout 1
        else status=inactive
            go to layout 2
        print match letter
        
    EX4: 
        Quick finds
        1. go to find mode
        2. send parameter, a, b, c, d, z
        3. show find result

        enter find mode --> pause:off
        set Error Capture On
        set field --> cusomer last name , get scriptParameter
        Perform find
        if Get(LastError) <> 0  
            show custome Dialog --> warning; NO record show starts with Get(ScripParameter)
            Show All Records
        End If

    send mail, can't send large set of emails or  SMTP server --> use Calculations ...

17. Script Trigger -->  like js events, action plus Scripts
    object-based:
    1) check spelling before save:
        onObjectSave --> check selection spelling, before save check spelling

    2) Track the changes of customer names:
        onObjectEnter
            $$Existing : Customer full name
        onObjectSave 
            Commit Records/requests --> skip data validation, dialog off
            Set Variable --> $$Current Customer full name
            Go to Object --> Object name 'N' (name of the Note tab filed)
            Set Field --> target filed Customer::Notes,
                        Customers::Notes & Â¶ & "Previous Contact was: "& $$Existing & "on " & Get(CurrentTimestamp)
    layout-based ..?
    file-based ..
